# Use Neo4j Aura

Neo4j Aura is a fully managed cloud graph database. It's the easiest way to get started with `create-context-graph` without running Neo4j locally.

## Prerequisites

- A [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/) account (free tier available)

## Step 1: Create an Aura Instance

1. Go to [console.neo4j.io](https://console.neo4j.io)
2. Click **New Instance**
3. Choose **AuraDB Free** (or a paid tier for production)
4. Select a region close to you
5. Click **Create**
6. **Save the generated password** — you'll need it in the next step

## Step 2: Download the `.env` File

After creating the instance, Neo4j Aura offers a **Download .env** button. This file contains your connection credentials:

```env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-generated-password
```

Save this file somewhere accessible.

## Step 3: Scaffold Your Project

Use the `--neo4j-aura-env` flag to import your Aura credentials directly:

```bash
uvx create-context-graph my-app \
  --domain healthcare \
  --framework pydanticai \
  --neo4j-aura-env /path/to/Neo4j-xxxxxxxx-Created-2026-03-28.txt \
  --demo-data
```

This will:
- Parse the `.env` file for connection details
- Configure the generated project to use your Aura instance
- Set `neo4j_type` to `aura` automatically

## Step 4: Verify the Connection

After scaffolding, verify the connection:

```bash
cd my-app
make test-connection
```

You should see:

```
✅ Connected to Neo4j Aura (neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io)
```

## Step 5: Seed Data and Start

```bash
make install
make seed
make start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused

- Ensure your Aura instance is **Running** (not paused)
- Free-tier instances pause after 3 days of inactivity — resume from the Aura console
- Check that `NEO4J_URI` starts with `neo4j+s://` (TLS required for Aura)

### Authentication failed

- Double-check the password in your `.env` file
- If you lost the password, reset it from the Aura console under **Instance settings**

### Slow queries

- Free-tier Aura instances have limited resources — queries may take 2-5 seconds
- For better performance, upgrade to a paid tier
